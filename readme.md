# Yuunagi

Yuunagi (夕凪) is a collection of tools used in my personal archiving procedure.

Yuunagi is created for my DataArchive2022 project, which includes saving data on hard disks and blu-ray disks.

## Tools

### `encrypt-archive.py`

Create archives with optional encryption.

## License

WTFPL. These tools are made for _my_ own needs, so feel free to fiddle with these tools to fit _your_ own needs.
